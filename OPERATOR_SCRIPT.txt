	0	Hello! My name is Rovy. I am an artificially intelligent agent sent 
		to play a game with you today. I hope you'll have fun with this. 

		I'll explain the rules to the Coin Entrustment game.

		We'll play a few rounds. At the beginning of each round, we'll each get 10 coins, and we'll choose to give each other between 0 and 10 of those coins. After we exchange coins, we need to decide if we're going to give those coins back to each other. Coins that are returned will double in value. 

		So, for example, if I give you 5 coins and you choose to give them back to me, I'll double my investment and get 10 coins in return. But if you decide to keep them, you gain those coins and I get nothing. 

		I'm a little hard of hearing so please speak loudly and clearly. You can say "pause" at any time to pause the game.

		Are you ready to play?
